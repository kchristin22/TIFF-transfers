# TIFF-transfers

This is a Google sheets add-on meant for internal use by the Thessaloniki International Film Festival transfers department. 

It executes two functions:
* Fill pickup times from the sheet "list" to "Sheet1" based on the guests' id
* Groups passengers for drivers, including pickup information and destination
